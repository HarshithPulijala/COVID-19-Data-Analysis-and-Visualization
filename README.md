# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
 

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using a real-world dataset. It focuses on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths to uncover patterns, identify top affected countries, and visualize the pandemic's progression.

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze total confirmed cases across countries
- Compute key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation of cases
- Visualize the most affected countries using bar plots
- Compare recovery and death rates using scatter plots
- Display case distribution (Active, Recovered, Deaths) for a selected country (e.g., India)

---

## 📁 Dataset Features

The dataset (`covid_data.csv`) includes:

- `Country/Region`: Country name
- `Confirmed`: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases
- `Recovered`: Total recovered cases
- `Deaths`: Total deaths
- `Active`: Currently active cases
- `Deaths / 100 Cases`: Death rate per 100 confirmed cases
- `Recovered / 100 Cases`: Recovery rate per 100 confirmed cases

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Bar Chart**: Top 10 countries by confirmed cases
- **Scatter Plot**: Death rate vs Recovery rate
- **Pie Chart**: India's case distribution (Active vs Recovered vs Deaths)
